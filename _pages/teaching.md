During my time at Caltech, I got heavily involved with teaching, serving as a teaching assistant (TA) and, eventually, as an instructor for a course I developed as part of <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cs-12">CS 12 (Student-taught topics in computing)</a>. I find that I am deeply inspired and motivated to help educate the new generation of scientists to come! Here are some highlights from my journey in teaching (thus far):

## **CS 12 - Introduction to Network Science** (Instructor)
This is a course that I developed during my junior year at Caltech and taught during the Fall and Spring quarters of my senior year. The purpose of this course is to give students a gradual introduction to the mathematical and computational foundations of networks, with particular emphasis on *how* we can use networks to model and analyze real-world systems. The course is divided into three main parts:

1. Network basics & Centrality measures
2. Community detection algorithms
3. Epidemic & Information spread

Each topic is accompanied by a coding "mini-project", which I designed, in order to give students hands-on experience analyzing networks using the tools developed in lecture. The last part of the course is devoted to a small self-guided project, where students can apply the techniques we developed to analyze a network of their choice. If you have any questions about the course or the course material feel free to reach out!

## **ACM 104 - Applied Linear Algebra**
To this day, ACM 104 (description found <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/acmids-104">here</a>) is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken! Here are some of my contributions during my two years of serving as a TA for ACM 104:

* I designed and developed MATLAB livescripts for coding problems. These livescripts were given to students in order to help with their understanding and implementation of algorithms. The livescripts also served as a smooth transition to coding in MATLAB, since a lot of students did not have prior experience
* I was in charge of leading the official exam review sessions (midterm and final). My approach in these review sessions was to solve problems *with* the students in order to review the material, give them some idea of what we might ask in the exam, and get some practice solving linear algebra problems
* I held weekly office hours and oversaw grading for the whole course

## **ACM 11 - Intro to Computational Science**
ACM 11 (description found <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/acm-11">here</a>) is a wonderful course aimed primarily towards first-year undergrads. The purpose of the course is to teach students MATLAB, and provide hands-on experience with some of the most commonly-used computational methods in science and engineering. Here are some of my contributions during my two years of serving as a TA for ACM 11:

* I attended weekly lectures to help students with in-class coding exercises. Doing this allowed me to aid students with bridging the gap between lecture material and homework material, and it also allowed me to answer any conceptual questions the students had
* I designed and led introductory "problem-solving with MATLAB" recitations
* I help weekly office hours and was responsible for grading assignments
