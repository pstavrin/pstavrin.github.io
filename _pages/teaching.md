During my time at Caltech, I got heavily involved with teaching, serving as a teaching assistant (TA) and, eventually, as an instructor for a course I developed as part of <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cs-12">CS 12 (Student-taught topics in computing)</a>. I find that I am deeply inspired and motivated to help educate the new generation of scientists to come! Here are some highlights from my journey in teaching (thus far):

## **CS 12 - Introduction to Network Science** (Instructor)
This is a course that I developed during my junior year at Caltech and taught during the Fall and Spring quarters of my senior year. The purpose of this course is to give students a gradual introduction to the mathematical and computational foundations of networks, with particular emphasis on *how* we can use networks to model and analyze real-world systems. The course is divided into three main parts:

1. Network basics & Centrality measures
2. Community detection algorithms
3. Epidemic & Information spread

Each topic is accompanied by a coding "mini-project", which I designed, in order to give students hands-on experience analyzing networks using the tools developed in lecture. The last part of the course is devoted to a small self-guided project, where students can apply the techniques we developed to analyze a network of their choice. If you have any questions about the course or the course material feel free to reach out!

## ACM 104 - Applied Linear Algebra (Head TA)
To this day, ACM 104 (description found <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/acmids-104">here</a>) is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken! Here are some of my contributions during my two years of serving as a TA for ACM 104:

* I designed and developed MATLAB livescripts for coding problems. These livescripts were given to students in order to help with their understanding and implementation of algorithms. The livescripts also served as a smooth transition to coding in MATLAB, since a lot of students did not have prior experience
* I was in charge of leading the official exam review sessions (midterm and final). My approach in these review sessions was to solve problems *with* the students.
