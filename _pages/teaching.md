During my time at Caltech, I got heavily involved with teaching, serving as a teaching assistant (TA) and, eventually, as an instructor for a course I developed as part of <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cs-12">CS 12 (Student-taught topics in computing)</a>. I find that I am deeply inspired and motivated to help educate the new generation of scientists to come! Here are some highlights from my journey in teaching (thus far):

#### The quarterly results look great!
- Revenue was off the chart.
- Profits were higher than ever.

*Everything* is going according to **plan**.
