I'm a first year PhD student in Computational Science and Engineering [(CSE)](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I'm advised by [Elizabeth Qian](https://www.elizabethqian.com/).

Primarily, I am interested in model reduction for inverse problems. This means that I am interested in developing mathematical theory and algorithms for solving inverse problems fast and accurately.

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was an undergraduate student at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) where I obtained my BS in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) from the [department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/). While at Caltech, I worked with [Kostia Zuev](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~zuev/) on a few network-related projects.
