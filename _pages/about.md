I'm a first year PhD student in Computational Science and Engineering [(CSE)](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I'm grateful to be advised by [Elizabeth Qian](https://www.elizabethqian.com/).

Broadly, I am interested in model reduction for inverse problems. This means that I am interested in developing mathematical theory and algorithms for solving inverse problems in a computationally efficient manner.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
